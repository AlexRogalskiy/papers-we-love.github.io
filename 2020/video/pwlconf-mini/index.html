<p><a href="https://connect.clickandpledge.com/w/Form/a9f96acc-aa05-4c52-a9b4-e12ab505abdf"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/all/themes/custom/cotija/images/logo.svg" style="padding: 20px; float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0" /></a>Like many non-profit organizations (ourselves included) <a href="https://www.usenix.org/">USENIX</a> has struggled during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conferences made up a large part of their revenue streams, and their cancellation has deprived USENIX of operating funds. As a <a href="https://www.usenix.org/publications">major source of research papers</a> in Computer Science and Networking we'd like to help anyway we can. <strong>So we're going to try something new to help raise donations for USENIX: a streaming mini-conference.</strong></p>

<h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>17:45 EST</strong> Panel led by <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/">Adrian Colyer</a>, with guests <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/ada/">Ada Gavrilovska</a>, <a href="">Joe Hellerstein</a>, <a href="https://drkp.net/">Dan R. K. Ports</a>, <a href="https://www.justinesherry.com/">Justine Sherry</a> and <a href="">Hakim Weatherspoon</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>18:35 EST</strong> <a href="https://research.google/people/jeff/">Jeff Dean</a> - The Rise of Cloud Computing Systems</li>
  <li><strong>19:30 EST</strong> <a href="https://irenezhang.net/">Irene Zhang</a> - The <a href="https://github.com/demikernel/demikernel">Demikernel</a> and the Future of Kernel-Bypass Systems</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/paperswelove">stream live on Twitch</a>, aftwerwards we'll post the video to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PapersWeLove">YouTube channel</a> once we've done some editing.</p>

<p><strong>This is a fund raiser</strong> so we're asking everyone who attends to <a href="https://connect.clickandpledge.com/w/Form/a9f96acc-aa05-4c52-a9b4-e12ab505abdf">make a donation to USENIX</a>. Almost every local chapter of Papers We Love has presented a paper from USENIX over the years, so this is our chance to give back.</p>

<p><strong>Jeff Dean</strong></p>

<p><em>Abstract</em>: In this talk, I'll highlight some of the developments in cloud computing systems over the past two decades.  I'll also describe why machine learning systems have dramatically changed some of the kinds of computer systems we want to build.</p>

<p><em>Bio</em>: Jeff Dean joined Google in 1999 and is currently a Google Senior Fellow and leads Google Research and Google Health, which focus on basic computer science and AI research and their use in important problem domains. He has worked on various computer systems including Google's search and advertising systems, MapReduce, BigTable, Spanner, and open-source software such as TensorFlow, protocol buffers, and LevelDB.</p>

<p>Jeff has a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Washington and a B.S. in Computer Science &amp; Economics from the University of Minnesota. He was awarded the 2012 ACM Prize in Computing, and is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Fellow of the ACM</p>

<p><strong>Irene Y. Zhang</strong></p>

<p><em>Abstract</em>: This talk presents the <a href="https://github.com/demikernel/demikernel">Demikernel</a> [<a href="http://irenezhang.net//papers/demikernel-hotos19.pdf">Paper</a>], a new OS architecture for kernel-bypass I/O devices.  Demikernel hides device complexity and heterogeneity by defining a new high-level, kernel-bypass I/O API and implementing it using different user-level, library OSes for each device type I will discuss the challenges in designing kernel-bypass library OSes and the future research directions in kernel-bypass for datacenter applications.</p>

<p><em>Bio</em>: My research focuses on datacenter operating systems and distributed systems.</p>

<p>I completed my PhD in 2017 at the University of Washington, where I was advised by Hank Levy and Arvind Krishnamurthy. My thesis is on distributed systems for applications that span mobile devices and cloud servers. Before my PhD, I received my S.B. and M.Eng. from MIT and worked for 3 years in the virtual machine monitor group at VMware.</p>

<p>I was born in Beijing, China but spent most of my time growing up in Columbus, Indiana. My husband and I like to cook, travel and occasionally do computer science together.</p>

<p><strong>Dan R. K. Ports</strong> - Panelist</p>

<p>I am a researcher in the Systems Research Group at Microsoft Research.</p>

<p>My research focuses on distributed systems – using a combination of new algorithms and systems techniques to build practical systems that are faster, more reliable, easier to program, and more secure.</p>

<p>I take a broad view of the systems field: besides distributed systems, I've worked in operating systems, networking, databases, architecture, and security. I believe that looking across the entire systems stack yields interesting opportunities at the intersection of these areas.</p>

<p>Most of my work these days involves rethinking how distributed systems should be built for the datacenter environment. I lead the Prometheus project at MSR, which asks how we can use new reconfigurable devices, such as programmable dataplane switches and smart NICs, to support advanced systems applications. The key idea is to co-design distributed systems with new network primitives.</p>

<p>Before joining MSR, I was on the faculty in CSE at the University of Washington. I still advise a few excellent students over there.
An increasingly long time ago (i.e., 2012), I was a student at MIT, where I was (approximately) Barbara Liskov's last Ph.D. graduate. Even before that, I was an undergraduate at MIT.</p>
